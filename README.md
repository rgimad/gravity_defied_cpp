# About the fork

- overhauled saving data to files (simplified, changed it to a C/C++ way)
- fixed: game does not save progress after the first save
- fixed: saving high score
- overhauled controls logic (simplified, per key setting instead of predefined key sets)
- added fullscreen and proper scaling for different aspect ratios
- renamed portions of a code to something meaningful

# TODO

- [X] create saves directory and global setting file when missing
- [ ] config file
- [X] command line flags
- [ ] level file selector
- [ ] further refactoring
- [ ] scaling game (or at least font)
